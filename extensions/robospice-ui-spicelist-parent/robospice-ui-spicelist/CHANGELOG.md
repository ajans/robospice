Release 1.4.1 (planned)

* UI SpiceList APIs got refactored. The new API is not backward compatible but is much more simple and elegant to implement.
* UI SpiceList now uses the BitmapRequest from the core module to download bitmap and cache them scaled and downsampled.
* Thx to Sergej Koščejev for adding parent parameter in view creation https://github.com/octo-online/robospice/pull/76
